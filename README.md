3rd-year AI Engineering and Data Science student passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Skilled in Python, SQL, and Power BI, with hands-on experience in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing datasets. Seeking an internship opportunity to apply analytical and problem-solving skills in a real-world business context.

üí° What I Do

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Using Python (pandas) to audit, clean, and prepare complex datasets.

Database & Analytics: Designing schemas and using SQL to query databases (MySQL) and extract KPIs.

Data Visualization: Building interactive dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights effectively.

Data Integrity: Identifying data limitations and communicating their impact on business metrics.

üöÄ Featured Projects

Superstore Sales & Operations Analytics

Executed an end-to-end analysis on 9,800 sales records, from data auditing and cleaning in Python to an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Audited data quality, identifying significant data integrity issues: 5,800+ missing Order_Date rows (60%) and 1,283 corrupted Ship_Date records (32% of remaining data).

Communicated these "Data Limitation" red flags via dashboard annotations (‚ö†Ô∏è) to prevent stakeholders from making decisions based on distorted data.

Tools: Python (Pandas), Power BI (DAX, Power Query), SQL, Git

Book Sales Data Cleaning & KPI Analysis

Cleaned and audited sales (booksales.csv) and book (books.csv) data by handling missing values, validating data types, and removing duplicates.

Designed a MySQL database schema and imported the cleaned data into structured tables for scalable analytics.

Built SQL-based KPI reports (e.g., Total Revenue: ‡∏ø45K, Top Genre: Comic ‡∏ø19K, AOV: ‡∏ø378) to enable actionable business insights.

Tools: Python (Pandas), SQL, MySQL, Google Colab
