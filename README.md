🚀 Featured Projects

Superstore Sales & Operations Analytics

Executed an end-to-end analysis on 9,800 sales records, from data auditing and cleaning in Python to an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Audited data quality, identifying significant data integrity issues: 5,800+ missing Order_Date rows (60%) and 1,283 corrupted Ship_Date records (32% of remaining data).

Communicated these "Data Limitation" red flags via dashboard annotations (⚠️) to prevent stakeholders from making decisions based on distorted data.
